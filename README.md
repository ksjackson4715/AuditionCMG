to start, i created an array for each option (temp1, temp2, hum1, hum2)
then to calculate mean, variance, and standard deviation of each group

then compare them all and make sure within the mean and standard deviation
**had a few issues determining best way to approach this, but I started with a basic option**

for automation would want to import file
have the array table created for all data
then have the math calculated, compared, and output the necessary answer for Ultra, Very, or Precise.

needed to create a basic script, once everything worked, called, and calcualted successfully
then simplify into an automation that can be called to pull the file(s) and then run the script to output proper information about the thermometers information

I broke it down piece by piece in the doc provided so that way I made sure to capture all the data
to begin with i was inputting manually to test the script and that it worked properly

Create an Array >>

**had a few issues determining best way to approach this, but I started with a basic option**
pull standard deviation and compare against all records >>
create boolean expression on if it is within standard deviation >> 
create check for within mean- if within certain amount, label appropriately
then output based on what has been pulled from script
